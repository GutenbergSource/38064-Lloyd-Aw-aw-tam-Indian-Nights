<HTML><BODY><p>A collection of Indian legends, collected from a Pima Indian. 

<p><i>Wikipedia:</i> The Akimel O'odham or Pima are a group of American Indians living in an area consisting of what is now central and southern Arizona (USA) and Sonora (Mexico). The name means "river people". They are closely related to the Tohono O'odham (meaning "desert people", formerly known as Papago), the Hia C-ed O'odham, and the Sobaipuri, a now extinct group. The name "Pima" apparently comes from a phrase that means "I don't know", used repeatedly in their initial meeting with Europeans. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pima">More...</a>.

<p>Another version is already on-line at <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/sw/ain/index.htm">Sacred Texts</a>, but we re-do it here to obtain an unencumbered version for Project Gutenberg. I will let this text skip some rounds, and run a diff with the available on-line version to save us some work. (P1, P2, F1, diff with Sacred Texts version should be enough; I will check quality after P1)

<p>Fairly straightforward to proofread.</BODY></HTML>
